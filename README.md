# Upper bound on the witness for classical simulability

# List of the functions

## classical_witness.m
This function computes an upper bound on a generic witness for classical simulability, by evaluating a semidefinite program over all possible deterministic strategies.

## test.m
Example of upper bound computation in the case of an ensemble {\rho_x}_{x} with x \in [1,6] and measurements M_{b|y} = mub{y,b}*mub{y,b}', where M_{b|y} are the MUBs in dimension d.
